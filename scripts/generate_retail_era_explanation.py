\textbf{Retail Era Splits Explanation.} The post-zero-commission era (October 2019+) represents a structural break in retail participation. However, \emph{optionability} and \emph{breadth} capture different dimensions of market access:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optionability} reflects \emph{derivative access}---whether a stock has listed options, indicating institutional sophistication and hedging capacity.
    \item \textbf{Breadth} reflects \emph{institutional ownership breadth}---the fraction of institutional managers holding the stock, indicating information processing and price discovery.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why Post×Not-Optionable ≈ 0:} Non-optionable stocks are typically microcaps with limited institutional following. The zero-commission change primarily affected \emph{retail trading costs}, not institutional ownership patterns. Since non-optionable stocks had minimal institutional presence both before and after the change, the interaction effect is negligible.

\textbf{Why Post×Low-Breadth is large:} Low-breadth stocks represent names where institutional information processing is limited. The zero-commission era increased retail participation in these stocks, amplifying sentiment-driven price movements. This effect is concentrated in stocks where institutional breadth was already low, creating the observed large interaction coefficients.

\textbf{Post-Date Definition:} October 1, 2019 (first trading day of October 2019), when major brokers eliminated commission fees for retail trades.

\textbf{Economic Interpretation:} The retail era analysis reveals that sentiment amplification effects are not uniform across all stocks. Instead, they are concentrated in stocks with limited institutional presence (low breadth) and amplified during periods of increased retail participation. This suggests that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Institutional arbitrage} is limited in low-breadth stocks, allowing sentiment effects to persist longer.
    \item \textbf{Retail participation} increased disproportionately in these stocks after zero-commission trading.
    \item \textbf{Sentiment amplification} is most pronounced when both conditions are met: low institutional breadth and high retail participation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Statistical Significance:} The analysis shows that post-zero-commission effects are statistically significant for low-breadth stocks across multiple horizons, with coefficients ranging from 46.53 to 77.88 basis points depending on the specification and horizon. The effects are robust to various control variables and fixed effects specifications.

\textbf{Policy Implications:} These findings suggest that regulatory changes affecting retail trading costs can have differential effects across stocks based on their institutional characteristics. Policymakers should consider the heterogeneous impact of such changes on market efficiency and price discovery.
